# Contributing to Forge Kit

Thank you for your interest in Forge Kit.

Forge Kit is an open-source project that primarily serves as a reusable foundation for Forge-based platforms. While contributions are welcome, the project is **maintained with a strong emphasis on architectural consistency and long-term stability**.

---

## Contribution Scope

We welcome:
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Clarifications to existing APIs
- Test improvements

We generally do **not** accept:
- Large feature additions without prior discussion
- Breaking API changes
- Opinionated rewrites of existing modules
- New modules without a clear architectural rationale

---

## Development Standards

All contributions must:
- Follow existing module structure and design principles
- Preserve backward compatibility where possible
- Include appropriate tests
- Pass all CI checks. See [GitHub Workflows](.github/workflows) for details.
- Follow Conventional Commits

Code is expected to remain:
- Explicit
- Readable
- Testable
- Free of hidden behaviour

---

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature or fix branch
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Ensure all CI checks pass
5. Open a pull request with a clear description

Pull requests are reviewed selectively and may be declined if they do not align with the project’s goals.

## Commercial Context

Forge Kit is a foundational library extracted from a commercial platform.

Acceptance of contributions does not imply:
- Long-term API stability guarantees
- Commercial support
- Inclusion in the Forge Platform
